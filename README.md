Hey there, I'm Cole! Iâ€™m a recent graduate of Union College in Lincoln Nebraska, with a BS in Computer Science and a Minor in Engineering.  I am originally from St. Helena, California, where I was born and raised, but I also spent time living in Germany when I was a child!  I'm currently working as a freelance Full Stack Developer for [Motionize](https://motionize.io/), [Hitsend](https://hitsend.io/), and [Volitant Technologies](http://volitantdrones.com/).

In my spare time I enjoy playing drums with my local band [The Zooeys](https://thezooeys.com/) and working on other music projects.  My other hobbies include downhill skateboarding, camping, and cycling!  Feel free to reach out with any business inquiries or questions!
